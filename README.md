# fractol
This project is meant to create graphically fractals.

Calculations are distributed using **pthread** functions, so 

## Control:
- ### Movement
   + #### left right up down
- ### Scale of actual mouse position
   + #### mouse wheel
- ### Change ITER count
   + #### + -
- ### Change color palette
   + #### PGUP PGDOWN
- ### Reset
   + #### enter
- ### Change fractals
   + #### NUM[1 - 7]

## Control for julia
  - ### Movement, change iter and change color unchanged.
  In mode "Julia" firsty you must select fractal using the rotation mouse, after you must press space\
  that you lock curently fractal. Now you can use the features described earlier.\
  If you press space again, you will return to the first step.
